Finite Element Analysis of a One-Dimensional Bar

Description
->This C++ program performs Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on a one-dimensional bar subjected to uniform axial loading. It computes nodal displacements, strains, and stresses using the finite element method (FEM) with linear shape functions. Additionally, the program allows users to visualize displacement and stress distributions via GNUPlot.

Features

->Solves for nodal displacements using the finite element method.
->Displays the computed global displacement vector.
->Computes displacement, strain, and stress at any specified position within the bar.
->Plots displacement and stress distributions using GNUPlot.

Prerequisites
->A C++ compiler (such as g++).
->GNUPlot installed for graph visualization.

Future Enhancements
->Support for variable cross-sectional areas and material properties.
->Integration of higher-order elements for improved accuracy.
->Additional boundary conditions and load cases.
